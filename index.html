	  University of South Wales - Second Year of Study<br>
	  
	  Throughout the duration of the course so far I have become skilled in C++, C# and Python with an understanding of SQL databasing. Outside of my studies I have delved into HTML and CSS to create this website and plan to begin some work in Swift for mobile app development. <br>
	  <br>
	  C++ <br>
	  The first year of study at USW was largly based around the development of fundamental programming skills in the module 'C++ Programming for Game Developers', which consisted of small tests and 2 sizable courseworks:<br>
	  
	  The first of these tasks (set early in the year) was the creation of a small racing game based on 'The Tortoise and The Hare', which consisted of a race between the two animals visualised on the system console. Each animal had a set of moves with different probabilities which effected both the direction and the speed of the animal's movement. I also implemented holes as an extension to the game, where the race track had randomised holes that the animals could fall into during the race. This encumbered the participant with a small time penalty, making them unable to perform their next move until a certain number of turns had passed. <br>
