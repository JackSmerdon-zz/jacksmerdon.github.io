	<a>University of South Wales: Second Year of Study </a><br>
	  
	  Throughout the duration of the course so far I have become skilled in C++, C# and Python with an understanding of SQL databasing. Outside of my studies I have delved into HTML and CSS to create this website and plan to begin some work in Swift for mobile app development. <br>
	  <br>
	  <a>C++</a> <br>
	  The first year of study at USW was largly based around the development of fundamental programming skills in the module 'C++ Programming for Game Developers', which consisted of small tests and 2 sizable courseworks:<br>
	  
	  The first of these tasks (set early in the year) was the creation of a small racing game based on 'The Tortoise and The Hare', which consisted of a race between the two animals visualised on the system console. Each animal had a set of moves with different probabilities which effected both the direction and the speed of the animal's movement. I also implemented holes as an extension to the game, where the race track had randomised holes that the animals could fall into during the race. This encumbered the participant with a small time penalty, making them unable to perform their next move until a certain number of turns had passed. <br> <br>
</p>

<p>
	  The second coursework was designed to test the C++ skills developed over the year, with a focus on the use of classes and inheritance in the form of a zombie survival game. Named 'Zombie Island', the aim of the game was to make the zombies, that were chasing the player, fall into the holes around the map without being caught. The player was also given the ability to choose the difficulty level between easy, medium and hard as well as being able to create a custom level. High scores were stored in a text file and could be displayed to the player by selecting ‘High Scores’ at the menu. Zombies had a basic AI where if they were 5 positions away from the player they would begin to pursue them, with a small probability that they would make a wrong turn during the pursuit which may allow the player to escape. <br> <br>

	  In year 2, the 'Data Structures And Algorithms With Object Oriented Programming" module has further improved my understanding of the language. The first of two courseworks (one of which is to be completed later in the year) was the implementation of a stack, queue and scheduler system using only the 'iostream' library. I was also instructed to devlop a system of prioritisation in addition to an anti-blocking mechanism to prevent tasks of high priority 'blocking' lower priority tasks from being completed. This, in addition to my other coursework examples, can be found on my GitHub by clicking on each visual example or the link at the bottom of the page. <br> <br>
	  
	  <a>OpenGL</a> <br>
	  
	  The 'Computer Graphics' module in the second year of my studies has been developing my skills in the graphics language OpenGL. Progressing from basic immediate mode rendering at the start of the year to the use of complex, interactive hierarchical models using Vertex Array Objects and Vertex Buffer Objects, I was able to produce a high quality scene for my OpenGL 2D coursework as demonstrated below. A 3D scene is currently in development for my second coursework submission which is due in May. <br><br>
