	<h1>University of South Wales: Second Year of Study </h1><br>
	  
	  Throughout the duration of the course so far I have become skilled in C++, C# and Python with an understanding of SQL databasing. Outside of my studies I have delved into HTML and CSS to create this website and plan to begin some work in Swift for mobile app development. <br>
</article>

<article class="articleShort">
	  <h1>C++</h1> <br>
	  The first year of study at USW was largly based around the development of fundamental programming skills in the module 'C++ Programming for Game Developers', which consisted of small tests and 2 sizable courseworks:<br>
	  
	  The first of these tasks (set early in the year) was the creation of a small racing game based on 'The Tortoise and The Hare', which consisted of a race between the two animals visualised on the system console. Each animal had a set of moves with different probabilities which effected both the direction and the speed of the animal's movement. I also implemented holes as an extension to the game, where the race track had randomised holes that the animals could fall into during the race. This encumbered the participant with a small time penalty, making them unable to perform their next move until a certain number of turns had passed. <br> <br>
	  
<div class="tort"></div><br>
  
	  The second coursework was designed to test the C++ skills developed over the year, with a focus on the use of classes and inheritance in the form of a zombie survival game. Named 'Zombie Island', the aim of the game was to make the zombies, that were chasing the player, fall into the holes around the map without being caught. The player was also given the ability to choose the difficulty level between easy, medium and hard as well as being able to create a custom level. High scores were stored in a text file and could be displayed to the player by selecting 'High Scores' at the menu. Zombies had a basic AI where if they were 5 positions away from the player they would begin to pursue them, with a small probability that they would make a wrong turn which gave the player some time to escape. <br> <br>
	  
<div class="zomb"></div><br>
  
	  In year 2, the 'Data Structures And Algorithms With Object Oriented Programming" module has further improved my understanding of the language. The first of two courseworks (one of which is to be completed later in the year) was the implementation of a stack, queue and scheduler system using only the 'iostream' library. I was also instructed to devlop a system of prioritisation in addition to an anti-blocking mechanism to prevent tasks of high priority 'blocking' lower priority tasks from being completed. This, in addition to my other coursework examples, can be found on my GitHub by clicking on the <a href="#contact">link at the bottom of the page.</a><br> <br>

	  <h1>OpenGL</h1> <br>
	  
	  The 'Computer Graphics' module in the second year of my studies has been developing my skills in the graphics language OpenGL. Progressing from basic immediate mode rendering at the start of the year to the use of complex, interactive hierarchical models using Vertex Array Objects and Vertex Buffer Objects, I was able to produce a high quality scene for my OpenGL 2D coursework as demonstrated below. A 3D scene is currently in development for my second coursework submission which is due in May. <br>

<article class="articleShort">
	<h1>C#</h1><br>
	The module 'Professional Practice and Employability' in both the first and second year of study has been the most relevant in the way of understanding the game development industry. The focus of the module in both years has been to produce a game in a small development team over a set period of time and present it to the course though an E3 style presentation at the end of the year. In the first year this was through the use of Stencyl (due to the anticipation that some students may be unable to code confidently) following on to using Unity 5 for the duration of this year.<br>
	The game being produced by my team and I this year (dubbed 'Chilly No Mates') follows the character of a university student as he tries to locate his items of clothing and possessions that he has lost from a wild night out in the city. 'Billy' has to complete various quests to regain his footing in the world and make it to the party at the end of the weekend. The game design document for the game that was written up by my team and I 
	<a href="Docs/Game.Design.Document.pdf">can be found here.</a><br>
	To date, I have written the inventory system for the character, aided in the picking up, dropping and storing of items and am currently working towards implementing an interactive phone similar to the one found in GTA V. I have also contributed towards the creation of the map, in addition to creating 3D models to be used as assets in Google SketchUp 2017. Samples of my contribution to this project can be produces on request as due to the nature of the project I am unable to share it here.<br>
	
	In addition to Unity Development, the module 'Tool Development for Computer Games' is currently furthering my knowledge of C# with the development of a XAML application. I have been tasked with creating a level creation tool for the 'Haunted Dungoen' game provided for the assignment which is a simple, 2D tile based game with the objective of getting the knight from the starting square to the stairs without making contact with a ghost.<br><br>

<article>
	<h1>Python</h1><br>
	The first half of the 'Tool Development' module was to implement an intepretation of the retro game 'Missile Command' through the use of Python and PyGame. Having no prior experience with the language was a challange, but I was able to pick it up fairly quickly and was able to produce the simple game demonstrated below. <br>

	  Years of skateboarding, photography and a strong interest in video sharing platforms have helped develop my video editing skills. Throughout the summer of 2017 I constructed a series of 10 vlogs which documented my lifestyle, which allowed me to further improve my filming and editing skills that I had obtained from recording skateboarding videos when I was younger. This allowed me to make the most out of my summer break, as constantly out looking for the next thing to include in my upcoming video kept me on the look out for exciting things to do in both a creative and engaging way. This also encouraged me to pick up surfing again, which I hope will now develop into a long term hobby. In the future I hope to produce more vlogs in addition to both entertaining and informative content on my YouTube channel, as providing both enjoyable and constructive content that benifits the community is what any creator aspires to produce.

<article>
 	  
  	  I am a hardworking and enthusiastic individual with a passion for gaming. Reliable and motivated, I have a friendly demeanour and a balanced approach to life.
	  Currently applying for an internship to to learn the ins and outs of the industry which will be continued by my final year of study. I then wish to progress to a Games Development MComp at either USW or elsewhere before starting my career as a game programmer. So far in my second year of study I have produced work to a high standard in every coursework I have submitted, including C++ and Python, which is a trend that I will maintain for duration of my studies.<br>
