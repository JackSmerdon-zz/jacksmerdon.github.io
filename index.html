      <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 150%">Hello!</p>
      <p>
        I'm Jack, a third year student at the <a href="https://icis.southwales.ac.uk/studentcourses/2128/studentcoursespecifications">University of South Wales studying Computer Games Development.</a> Despite the phrase 'Development', the course is highly directed towards programming over design with modules incorporating C#, C++, OpenGL, DirectX and Python across a diverse range of topics. Take a look at this showcase of the best work I have completed since the start of my degree, the headings of each section have links to repositories where more detailed information about each project can be found.

      <h3 class="subheading"> <i>  A 2nd Year  Team Game Development Module in Collaberation with Gregory Neale, William Akins, Mariya Hristozova & Sean Brennan. </i> </h3>
      <p>
        This open world game created by a team of 5 programmers in Unity 5 follows the character of Billy, who is left with none of his possessions when he wakes up in Central Park after a messy night out on the town.
        As Billy, you must navigate the city and surrounding suberbs to locate your missing clothes, phone, wallet and other items in order to make it to the next party on time.
        At this stage of development the game features a 5-10 minute tutorial section with demonstrations of features such as the inventory, questing, pickup/dropping of items, daytime cycle and bladder control. <br><br>

        Initially my task was to create a fully fledged inventory system inside an interactive GUI, with items stored in suitable catagories and displayed in an informative and intuitive manner.
        Objects that were collected by the player, using Sean's pick up and drop system, would be stored in the inventory with data available for the user to see such as descriptions, icons and quantity.
        From this interface the player would also have the ability to use the item or drop it back into the world. <br><br>

        As the project progressed, team and I decided that to make the game more emmersive it would be better to have the system displayed as an app on an interactive phone.
        The phone was initially intended to be found further along the story, however it was decided that it would be my responsibility to model a smartphone with a variety of apps for the user to interact with,
        including the re-implementation of the inventory system, to cover a variety of features that would usually require an on screen prompt or a GUI.
        In the latest build the player is able to interact with the phone both using the keyboard or controller to view their health app (Showing HP, Energy and Bladder), journal app for quests, the inventory and an anologue clock.
        Other apps such as the map, banking, camera and a social media platform were all planned but have not yet been implemented into the game. <br><br>

      <h3 class="subheading"> <i> 3rd Year Artificial Intelligence Coursework <br> Personal Assignment </i> </h3>
      <p>
        The Artificial Life coursework consisted of creating an ecosystem where two types of 'living' entities with different characteristics could survive in parallel. For this task it was decided that rabbits and grass would be a simple yet effective model for the system following the idea that: rabbits cannot survive without grass, too many rabbits will kill off the grass and no rabbits makes the grass population infinite. For the system to cycle successfully, there must be a balance where the rabbit population would peak just before the point where the grass will be killed off. <br> <br>
        The system was developed with genetic algorithms in mind, where the grass and rabbit variables that are highly influential on the system can be passed in when the system was instantiated. By manipulating these characteristics it would be possible to determine the optimal combination of variables to create the 'perfect' cycle of life.

      <h2 class="heading">Dino Park</h2>
      <h3 class="subheading"> <i> 3rd Year Artificial Intelligence Coursework <br> Personal Assignment - In Progress</i> </h3>
      <p>
        Using an updated version of an ancient Unity sample project, the Dino Park coursework consists of creating detailed AI for different types of dinosaurs on top of a code test bed. The hunting, herding and combat of Velociraptor's and Ankylosaurus' are to be featured in addition to efficient path finding and survival elements required to replicate realistic artificial life.
        <br><br>
        Game balancing will play a critical role in the success of the system, where the Raptors must be able to hunt the Ankys effectively but not well enough to destroy the population. The herbivores must be able to protect their herd and look after weaker members using neural networks to prioritise tasks.

      <h3 class="subheading"><i>3D Scene With Anti-Aliasing and VBO's</i></h3>
      <p>
        Following up from the second year coursework the task involved creating a detailed 3D scene, rendering it to an off screen texture and applying super-sampled anti-aliasing with phong shading using GLSL. <br> <br>
        The scene consisted of 4 different models with individual UV unwrapped textures, 3 point lights, a directional light and a skybox. The point lights, positioned as table lamps in the living room scene, cycle through the colour spectrum using out of phase sine waves to generate RGB values every frame.

      <p>
        Moving away from OpenGL and GLSL, the second coursework for the final year graphics module is to create a 3D Castle scene in DirectX (With HLSL shaders) showing a courtyard, tower or dungeon in addition to texture mapping, filtering, environment mapping, water and foliage effects. This piece of work is currently being developed with a due date of the 10th of May 2019.

      <h3 class="subheading"><i>Developers:<br>Khalid Ali, Jake Passmore, Nicky Jones & Steven Sparkes.<br>_</i></h3>
      <p>
        The Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge annually hosts the largest international student game jam in the UK and in 2018 I had the privilege of attending its 10th anniversary jam. The theme of the event was set as 'unreliable' and our team of 5 programmers were given 3 days (29.5 hours in the university computer labs) to produce an <i>unreliable</i> game. Development of the game was completed in Unity 2017 with the team using Github for version control.<br> <br>

        After much deliberation my team and I decided that the game would be set in the wild west, settling on the idea of a multiplayer mexican stand-off game which consisted of 4 players, each with a Nintendo Joy-Con contoller... <br> <br>

        The players stand in a circle and decide who they are going to shoot. Any player that survives gets a split of the pot of bananas. Whoever has the most bananas after a number of rounds wins. One of the key gameplay feature of the game is to use the arrow keys on the Joy-Con to attract the attention of another player using vibrations.
        This gives you the option to make an alliance in order to survive the round, although its up to you to determine how <i>reliable</i> this relationship will be as each player will ultimately be trying to win.

      <h2 class="heading">Global Game Jam 2019:<br><a href="https://itch.io/profile/jack-smerdon">There's No Place Like Home<br>(Unless your flatmates are home)</a></h2>
      <h3 class="subheading"><i>Developers:<br>Gregory Neale, William Akins, Sean Brennan, James Hopkins, Alex Akins, Katherine Axten, Daniel Collins & Katarzyna Kaminska.<br></i></h3>
      <p>
        The theme for the January 2019 GGJ was 'what home means to you', which developed into making a game about student accomodation as for most of this team this was their current 'home'. Student housing can often be a scary place, with only the small confined area of your bedroom really feeling cosy and safe. It was decided that the game should be based around the awkwardness and uncomfort of living with people that you don't get along with. The style of the game was then chosen to be very over exaggerated, with comedically styled characters and a spooky, almost horror undertone. This was brought to life by Alex and Katarzyna through visuals and Daniel through music.<br><br>

        The aim of the game is to complete objectives inside the house, such as having a shower and getting a glass of water, without getting caught by your house mates who have different AI 'personalities'. The game has a stealth element where the noise that you make will alert your housemates if they hear you. This is shown through a sound wave on the floor: the the louder the sound the bigger the disk. Sticky old wrappers that have been left around the house will get stuck on you if you are not careful, increasing the noise you make as you move around the building.
